# ASCII Mandelbrot Set Visualizer

A simple C program that generates an ASCII art visualization of the Mandelbrot set.

## Description

This program creates a text-based representation of the Mandelbrot set using ASCII characters. The intensity of each character represents how quickly a point escapes the set, with '#' marking points within the set.

## Features

- 80x40 character display resolution
- Complex plane mapping from (-2, -1) to (1, 1)
- Variable iteration depth (100 iterations max)
- Gradient ASCII character mapping for visual detail

## Building

Compile using any C compiler:
